ALPHA STAR PAPER Notes
========================================================================


The policy of AlphaStar is a function πθ(at | st,z) that maps all previous
observations and actions st = o1:t, a1:t − 1 (defined in Extended Data Tables 1, 2) 

observation 1 - t AND action 1 - (t - 1)

and z (representing strategy statistics) to a probability distribution
over actions at for the current step. πθ is implemented as a deep neural
network with the following structure

* The policy function itself, is a neural network.



The observations ot are encoded into vector representations,
combined, and processed by a deep LSTM9, which maintains
memory between steps.
